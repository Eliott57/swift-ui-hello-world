# üåê Hello, World ! - SwiftUI Project

Welcome to the Hello World SwiftUI App! This project serves as a simple demonstration of creating a basic SwiftUI view with a button that displays an alert saying "Hello, SwiftUI!" when clicked.

## Project Description

The Hello World SwiftUI App is a straightforward yet essential project showcasing SwiftUI's capabilities. The app consists of a single view featuring a button labeled "Hello, World." When users tap the button, it triggers an alert that says "Hello, SwiftUI!" The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to set up a SwiftUI interface, handle user actions, and display basic alerts.
  
## What I Learned

In this project, I focused on the following aspects:

1. **SwiftUI View Creation:** I built a minimal SwiftUI view with a button that responds to user interaction.

2. **Handling Button Actions:** I implemented the button action to trigger the display of an alert when clicked.

3. **Alert Presentation:** I utilized SwiftUI's native alert functionality to present a user-friendly message.
